There are mainly three keywords used to declare a variable.They are:
    1.var
    2.let
    3.const

var:
    The variables declared with varfv has global scope.The Global variables can be accessed from anywhere in a JavaScript program.
    Variables declared with the var keyword cannot have Block Scope.Variables declared inside a block {} can be accessed from outside the block.
        eg:
            <!DOCTYPE html>
            <html>
            <body>

            <h2>JavaScript Scope</h2>

            <p>A GLOBAL variable can be accessed from any script or function.</p>

            <p id="demo"></p>

            <script>
            var fruitName = "banana";
            myFunction();

            function myFunction() {
            document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "I can display " + fruitName;
            }
            </script>

            </body>
            </html>
            <!-- Here fruit can be accessed from anywhere -->

Note:
    The same variable can't be used for declaring both var and let.
